# WhatsApp Integration Setup Guide

## ðŸš¨ Important: Fix "Phone number isn't on WhatsApp" Error

The error you're seeing occurs because the current phone number in the code (`+91 98765 43210`) is a placeholder/test number that is not registered on WhatsApp.

**Current Status**: The system is configured with a test number that doesn't exist on WhatsApp, which is why you're getting the error message.

## ðŸš€ Quick Fix (2 Minutes)

**If you already have WhatsApp on your phone:**

1. Open `client/src/config/business.ts`
2. Replace `number: '91XXXXXXXXXX'` with your actual WhatsApp number (without +)
   - Example: If your number is +91 98765 43210, use `'919876543210'`
3. Replace `displayNumber: '+91 XXXXXXXXXX'` with your number (with +)
